# CSS Stylesheets Directory

This folder contains all the CSS stylesheet files used in the CSS_advanced projects of the Holberton School Web Front-End curriculum.

## 🗂️ Structure

- Multiple CSS files named sequentially (e.g., `1-style.css`, `2-style.css`, ..., `32-style.css`).
- Each file typically focuses on a specific topic or exercise related to advanced CSS techniques.

## 🎯 Purpose

The stylesheets cover a wide range of CSS concepts, including but not limited to:

- Selectors and specificity
- Box model and layout techniques
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Transitions and animations
- Responsive design with media queries
- Positioning strategies (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`)

## 🔧 Usage

These CSS files are linked to corresponding HTML files in the project to demonstrate practical applications of the concepts learned.

Example usage in HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/1-style.css">
```
